4. The GUI (Graphical User Interface, use streamlit)

This is the "friendly face" that ties everything together for the user!   

Input: Allows users to either load an image file or automatically create an image from a folder.  

Control: A good GUI lets the user set hyper-parameters and choose which ML model to use.  

Output: Shows the final recognized number and visualizes the results (like showing the segmentation or the model's confidence). 

What to do: Build the window where the user interacts. It needs a button to "Load Image" and a place to show the "Result." If you want a High Distinction (HD), add sliders for "hyper-parameters" or a way to choose which model to run.   What to use to test: Use "Mock Data." Even if the AI isn't ready, make the button print "I think this is a 5" just to prove the button works!
The Goal: A user-friendly experience that doesn't crash when someone clicks too fast. 
Success Metric: Can a non-tech person use it without instructions?
